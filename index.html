    <p>
      <font size="6" face="Times New Roman">The</font> Universe is governed by the laws of physics, and one of the most fundamental forces that
      shapes the cosmos is gravity. From the orbits of planets around their parent stars to the stunning spirals of
      galaxies, gravity is an invisible force that dictates the movement of celestial bodies. Understanding the
      intricacies of this force is a pursuit that has captivated scientists and astronomers for centuries, leading to
      the
      development of various theories and models. One of the most intriguing and computationally challenging approaches
      to
      simulate gravity's effects on multiple interacting objects is the n-body gravity simulation. In this article, we
      will delve into the world of n-body gravity simulations, by building a 2 dimensional gravity simulation ourselves.

  <h2><b>Setting Up</b></h2>
  <font face="Verdana">
    <p>
      Firstly, we have to create a development environment using nodejs so that we can use typescript. Since the steps for setting up differ in Windows, Linux or OS X, I recommend using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/">this</a> guide to set up your development environment.
    </p>

    <b>Implementation</b>
  </h2>
  <h3>The Vector 2 class</h3>
  <font face="Verdana">
    <p>
      In our simulation, we will use Vectors to represent the physical properties of the particles. So, lets begin by defining a Vector 2 class
    </p>
      <img src="./assets/Vector2-class-dark.png" alt="Vector 2 Class Definition" width="360px" align="center" />
    <p>
      While we are at it, let's also add a few methods to our Vector 2 class that will be used later in our simulation.
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/Vec2-methods-dark.png" alt="Vector 2 Class Methods" width="360px" align="center" />
    <p>
      Out of all the methods, the most interesting implementation might be of the <font face="Monospace"><i>normalise</i></font> method. Instead of directly dividing the components of the vector by it's length, the method instead multiplies or scales the components of the vector by its inversed length which is essentially the same thing, but this way, the method run is a little more performant as computers perform multiplication operations faster than division operations. And this becomes noticable when the simulation is scaled.
    </p>
  </font>

  <h3>The Particle class</h3>
  <font face="Verdana">
    <p>In our simulation, we will use particles that will be affected by each other's gravity. Let's define a particle.</p>
    <img src="./assets/Particle-def-dark.png" alt="Particle class definition" width="360px" align="center" />
    <br><br>
    <p>
      We have also defined a few default values that our particles will use in case they're not defined when a particle class is instantiated.
    </p>
  </font>

  <h3>The Physics of Gravity Simulations</h3>
  <font face="Verdana">
    <p>
      Now that we have our vector and particle classes, we can start building our Physics Stepper that calculates the gravitational force and updates the positions of our particles. But first, we have to understand the formula for gravity. Which is defined as
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <font color="#333" size="5" face="Times New Roman">
          F = (G × m<sub>1</sub> × m<sub>2</sub>)/r<sup>2</sup>
        </font>
    </p>
    <p>Where <i>G</i> is the Gravitational Constant, <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> are the respective masses of two particles, and <i>r</i> is the distance between the two particles. The Gravitational Constant approximately equals to
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <font color="#333" size="5" face="Times New Roman">
          G = 6.6743 × 10<sup>-11</sup>m<sup>3</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>
      </font>
    </p>
    <p>
      But before we start use this formula, we need to compute the distance between the two particles. For which, we can use the distance formula, that is
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <font color="#333" size="5" face="Times New Roman">
          r = &radic;((x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + ((y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)
      </font>
    </p>
    <p>
      But, there is a better way which uses the length of the direction from p<sub>1</sub> to p<sub>2</sub>. If you look at it, we are essentially performing the same calculations as we would if we were to use the distance formula but this is much simpler. We would computer the direction (<i>d</i>) and distance (<i>r</i>) as
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <font color="#333" size="5" face="Times New Roman">
          d' = p<sub>1</sub> - p<sub>2</sub>
          <br>
          r = |d'|
          <br>
          d = d' / |d'|
      </font>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we have the distance, we can apply the Gravity formula to obtain the Gravitational Force (<i>F</i>) experienced by <i>P<sub>1</sub></i>. Then, we can compute acceleration (<i>a</i>) by restructuring the formula for Force (<i>F</i>) which is <i><b>F = m × a</b></i> as
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <font color="#333" size="5" face="Times New Roman">
          a = F / m
      </font>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we can multiply acceleration <i>a(t + 1)</i> with direction <i>(d)</i> and add the result to velocity <i>v(t)</i> to get the new velocity as:
    </p>
     <p align="center">
      <font color="#333" size="5" face="Times New Roman">
          v(t + 1) = v(t) + a(t + 1) × d
      </font>
    </p>
    Then we can compute the new position using:
     <p align="center">
      <font color="#333" size="5" face="Times New Roman">
          x(t + 1) = x(t) + v(t + 1) × &Delta;t
      </font>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's implement this in code after we defining a few constants namely the Gravitational Constant (<i>G</i>), average particle mass (<i>avg_mass</i>), the deviation for average particle mass (<i>mass_deviation</i>), a radius for our particles and a fixed timestep that we will later compute ourselves. Most of these values will be used later when we create our particles.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/Constants-dark.png" alt="Constants" width="360px" align="center" />
    <p>And here is the implementation of the above explained math:</p>
    <img src="assets/translateToNewPosition-def-dark.png" alt="Constants" width="360px" align="center" />
    <p>
      Before we continue, let's see what happens to the other values if we change the mass of p<sub>1</sub>, while the mass of the other particle p<sub>2</sub> stays constant at 10<sup>8</sup>kg.

    <p>
      In the above table, we see that even though the force <i>F</i> keeps on increasing, it doesn't affect the acceleration. So, we have accidentally proved that objects experience the same acceleration due to gravity regardless of mass. This is because the force is divided by mass when we calculate acceleration. So that cancels out the effect mass has on Force. Let's conduct another experiment where we exponentially increase the length between two particles without changing any other parameters and see how that affects the Gravitational Force.

      We can also use this function to find out the acceleration due to gravity on earth (<i>g</i>), by using real measurements of the earth.
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/g-dark.png" alt="Acceleration due to gravity on earth"  width="360px" align="center" />
    <p>Since the result we obtained is very close to the real value of <i>g</i>, We can say that our implementation is correct. We now have only two things left to do, render our particles to the screen, and create an update loop. Let's write some code to spread the particles on the screen using the constants we defined earlier and two new constants which we will use to make the spread area circular, we will also colour our particles using hsl, and then use the Canvas2DAPI to render them to the screen.</p>
    <img src="./assets/particle-initiator-dark.png" alt="Particle Initiator code" width="360px" align="center" />
    <p>For rendering, we need to add a canvas element with a id "canvas" to our html, then we can reference that canvas using typescript. We can use css for resizing the canvas. (The html and css code have not been shown)</p>
    <img src="./assets/canvas-init.png" alt="Particle Initiator code" width="360px" align="center" />
    <p>
      The above code only gets a canvas from the DOM, resizes it and initiates a Canvas2DRenderingContext. For actually drawing the particles to the screen, we need to define a function called `render` in my implementation and then call the render method on each particle.
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/render-def-dark.png" alt="Particle Initiator code" width="360px" align="center" />
    <p>
      Finally, we have got the particles rendering on our screen, the colours appear in a nice Gradient because we set the hue of the colour based on <i>theta</i>.
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/first-output.png" alt="Particle Initiator code" width="360px" align="center" />
    <p>At last, we can write our loop function that computes deltatime <i>dt</i>, updates the position of our particles and renders them to the screen after clearing it.</p>
    <img src="./assets/final-dark.png" alt="Particle Initiator code" width="360px" align="center" />
    <p>
      And with that, we have a working n-body Gravity Simulation.

    <b>Limitations</b>
  </h2>
  <font face="Verdana">
    <p>
      While our algorithm is very accurate, it is also very inefficient. It has a Time Complexity of O(n<sub>2</sub>) because we used a naive implementation. However, there are ways to improve the performance of this simulation by a lot. A few solutions to improve the efficiency of this algorithm and speed up rendering have been discussed below

        <h4>Rendering on the GPU using WebGL or WebGPU.</h4>
        </dt>
      <dd>
        The Canvas2DAPI is simple to use, however it uses the CPU for rendering. And even in some cases when it uses the GPU, it still draws the particles on the screen one by one. But, WebAPIs like WebGL take advantage of the device's GPU's Parallelization and is able to draw 20 million particles in one second in even a slow computer. WebGPU is an even better choice however WebGPU is not fully supported by all browsers yet.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <h4>Barnes Hut Algorithm</h4>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The Barnes Hut algorithm groups together bodies which are at a sufficient distance from each other using a data structure called a Quadtree. This algorithm reduces our time complexity from O(n<sup>2</sup>) to O(n log n) which is a very significant improvement.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <h4>Spatial Grid</h4>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          We could also use a more efficient method than Barnes Hut Algorithm, where we group the bodies together using a Binary-tree like data structure which is split based on the Arithmetic mean of the positions of the bodies inside it. We can use a tree walking algorithm to simulate our particles.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <h4>GPU Spatial Grid</h4>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          We could divide our simulation's bounds into several smaller parts or a grid, and then use a GPU sorting algorithm like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter">Batcher’s Bitonic Sort</a> and group our particles. This method can provide significant improvements by using the GPU's massive parallelization capabilities to it's advantage.
